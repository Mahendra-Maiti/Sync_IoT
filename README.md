# Sync_IoT


This project is aimed at intelligent routing of data from IoT devices to cloud via an edge platform acting as an ubiquitous middle layer. Our main objective was to provide continuous delivery of data to the cloud with high accuracy and consistency. To scope down the problem at hand, we looked at scenarios where data is not necessarily required to be streamed live but could tolerate some delay at the cost of being filtered out. This type of framework is generally suitable for sensor devices like carbon monoxide detector, temperature & humidity measuring devices where real time data availability is not the primary concern but reliability of data is very critical. During data analysis, false positives should be very low to prevent erroneous inferences.


## System Architecture

There are 4 main components in the proposed system. They are described below:

1.	**Client**:
Here, the IoT device acts as a client, and to mimic the behavior of an IoT device, we run a process without any persistent data store and limited bandwidth (to limit this we run this process on LTE network). Client occasionally streams data points to a specific (most optimized node in terms of distance, compute capacity, memory and storage capacity) edge node using TCP socket connection. To simulate mobile behavior of clients, the experiments are setup in a way that the clients change their location after regular intervals. This movement is incorporated in the device module of the program.

2.	**Controller**:
Controller acts as an intelligent orchestrator, routing the data to the most feasible and optimized edge node based on the current location of the IoT device and the available resources in the edge node. All edge nodes communicate with the controller to share current resource statistics which in turn determines the most optimal edge node for any subsequent client request. 
After controller boot up, we provide a list of edge node addresses to be registered to it. On every subsequent 10 second intervals, the controller pings each of these edge nodes through exposed API endpoints to collect edge resource statistics. This is called a health check. Based on what response is received if at all, the controller decides on the most optimal edge node for a requesting IoT device. In case of no response, the controller removes the corresponding edge repository from its active list. This is used to mimic the scenario where an edge repository might be down.

3.	**Edge Node**:
This acts as a persistent data store for client data which gets synchronized with the cloud after filter operations. Every edge node has their own in-memory cache which stores data for a specified limited time. Every edge node has a worker running which pulls data from the cache, filters it depending on current policy, and synchronizes with the cloud. Thus each node has relevant processes running to take care of three things: receiving data from the client, sending API response to the controller to share resource statistics, and regular transfer of the persisted data from cache to cloud.

4.	**Cloud**:
We use AWSâ€™s FaaS (Function as a Service) framework to synchronize data from edge node to the cloud. On the end of the cloud, we employ S3 buckets as the final persistent data store where every bucket is mapped to a unique IoT (client) device. Using AWS API gateway, we expose a Lambda function which accepts edge node requests with incoming data in JSON format. The lambda function creates a file based on the device ID and timestamp, and subsequently uploads this uniquely named temporary file to the mapped S3 bucket.


The workflow of our designed system can be understood through the following figure:

## Fitness Function
The fitness function for selecting the most optimal edge repository for a particular requesting IoT device is:

This function is aimed to intelligently distribute the workload among active edge repositories such that the overall system performance is maximized.





## Results

- Employing a suitable filter function at the edge repository can greatly reduce the consumed network bandwidth while meeting requirements.

- Intelligent distribution of workload among edge repositories using fitness functions led to reduction in synchronization times.
